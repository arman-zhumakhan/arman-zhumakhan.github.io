<h3><a href="https://smilephoto.herokuapp.com/"> Smile Detection project on my website</a></h3>
<p>The classification model predicts whether a smiling person. It used the pretrained model ResNet34.  </p>
<p>It's deployed on Heroku for free, therefore, it may take longer to launch </p>

<h3><a href="https://github.com/arman-zhumakhan/arman-zhumakhan.github.io/blob/master/projects/Computer-Vision/report.pdf">Instance search (assignment in Computer Vision course)</a></h3>
<p>The task is to rank the photos by similarity given the query. Data consists of 5000 real photos that are taken from different points in different time, season.</p>
<p>The combined method of SIFT and ResNet50 showed the best result. <a href="https://github.com/arman-zhumakhan/arman-zhumakhan.github.io/blob/master/projects/Computer-Vision/cnn.ipynb">(code)</a></p>
