<!-- <h3><a href="https://smilephoto.herokuapp.com/"> Smile Detection project on my website</a></h3>
<p>The classification model predicts whether a smiling person. It used the pretrained model ResNet34.  </p>
<p>It's deployed on Heroku for free, therefore, it may take longer to launch </p>

<p>The task is to rank the photos by similarity given the query. Data consists of 5000 real photos that are taken from different points in different time, season.</p>
<p>The combined method of SIFT and ResNet50 showed the best result. <a href="https://github.com/arman-zhumakhan/arman-zhumakhan.github.io/blob/master/projects/Computer-Vision/cnn.ipynb">(code)</a></p>

<h3>Network analysis on flights worldwide</h3>
<p>This paper was a assignment in my <b>SDSC2004 Data Visualization</b> class at CityU. Charts were visualized by using Gephi</p>

<h3>Reinforcement Learning project with custom environment</h3>
<p>The project was a part of assignments in my <b>SDSC4001 Reinforcement Learning</b> class at CityU. 
    RL Environment was customized by me to make the project funnier. RL algorithms tries to the shortest path for the professor to go home by avoiding any students on his way.
    We applied Q-learning, DQN, and PPO algorithms and compared their differences.
