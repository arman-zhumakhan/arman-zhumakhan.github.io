# Zhumakhan Arman's portfolio

I created this website to reveal my projects to people who are interested to learn about Data Science projects and to check my knowledge.

I used [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) to create [arman-zhumakhan.github.io](https://github.com/arman-zhumakhan/arman-zhumakhan.github.io)

I made most of my projects while watching Machine Learning tutorials in EDx, Udemy. It helped my to acquire the basic necessary skills and to experince real Data Science work.


For reference:
Minimal Mistakes is a flexible two-column Jekyll theme, perfect for building personal sites, blogs, and portfolios.
