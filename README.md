# Zhumakhan Arman's portfolio

I created this website to reveal my projects to people who are interested to learn about Data Science projects and to check my knowledge.

I used [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) to create [arman-zhumakhan.github.io](https://github.com/arman-zhumakhan/arman-zhumakhan.github.io)

I made most of my projects while watching Machine Learning tutorials in EDx, Udemy. It helped me to acquire the necessary skills and experience real Data Science work.


For reference:
Minimal Mistakes is a flexible two-column Jekyll theme, perfect for building personal sites, blogs, and portfolios.
